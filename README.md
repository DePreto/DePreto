- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Konstantin. At the beginning of 2020 I was faced with a lack of development in the field of ecology and decided to choose a direction in which you can always learn new and interesting things.
So I made a decision to develop in python-development, which covers several areas I am interested in: web backend, ML, DE.

- ðŸŒ± Writing on python for 4 years +.
Commercial experience (3 year +) with python3: Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Docker, Pytest. 
Training projects with python3: Fastapi, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, asyncio.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: the best way - telegram: `@depreto` or mail: `depreto.kd@gmail.com`
