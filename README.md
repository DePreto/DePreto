- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Konstantin. In early 2020, I recognized a gap in the ecological sector's development and chose to pivot towards a field that promises constant learning and innovation. I embarked on a journey to specialize in Python development, which spans several of my areas of interest: web backend, machine learning, and data engineering.

- ðŸŒ± Writing on python for 2 years +.
Commercial experience with Python 3 includes working with technologies such as Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, S3, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Docker, and Pytest. I have also developed training projects utilizing FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, and asyncio to further enhance my skills in Python programming.
